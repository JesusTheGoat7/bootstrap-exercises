# Bootstrap Exercises

This repository contains a sample exercise for practising Bootstrap, a widely used front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites. 

The exercise involves transforming a webpage from a basketball theme to a soccer theme.

## Changes Made

Originally, the webpage contained a table dedicated to basketball players. However, this has been updated to feature famous soccer players instead. The changes in the HTML file include:

1. Updating the 'Team' column to 'Club', aligning with soccer terminology.
2. Replacing the 'All Star' column with 'FIFA Ballon d'Or', indicating whether the player has won this prestigious soccer award.
3. Modifying player names and their corresponding teams to reflect well-known soccer players and clubs.

## Usage

To view the webpage, simply clone the repository and open the HTML file in your preferred web browser.
